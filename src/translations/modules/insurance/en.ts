  faq: {
    airbnb: {
      question: "Do I need your guest damage insurance even though I'm listed on AirBnb or Booking.com?",
      answer: "Yes, although platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com offer their own protection, both have their pitfalls and limitations.\n\nAirbnb's AirCover is not an insurance product and will always involve guests, requiring them to pay for damages. Only if the guest refuses to pay can AirCover cover the damage. Reporting damage to Airbnb therefore always risks disputes with guests who deny responsibility or leave negative reviews. Additionally, AirCover only covers lost income from confirmed Airbnb bookings, leaving hosts who list on multiple platforms with cancellation costs and lost income.\n\nBooking.com's damage program merely facilitates damage settlement with your guests, and only if you've specifically set it up. The damage program is limited to €300 in the EU. This amount is displayed during the booking process and can negatively impact your booking conversion or search ranking."
    },
    deposit: {
      question: "Should I ask guests for a deposit?",
      answer: "A deposit can provide financial security in case the house is damaged during your guests' stay. It also ensures that guests take better care of the house during their stay as they want to receive their deposit back in full and therefore pay special attention to leaving the house in good condition.\n\nIn general, however, guests often avoid offers that require a deposit as it temporarily ties up money and can lead to deductions for minor issues.\n\nIf you choose Stellar guest damage insurance, you can avoid deposits altogether or offer your guests a convenient alternative.\n\nSince potential claims are usually handled without guest involvement, you can avoid disputes with guests – for more repeat bookings and more 5-star reviews."
    },
    coverage: {
      question: "What does your insurance cover?",
      answer: "Our vacation rental insurance was specifically developed for the individual needs of short-term rental hosts and owners.\n\nIt includes comprehensive and critical coverage for the following relevant cases:\n\n• Unintentional and malicious damage to your property (at replacement value), ensuring you don't suffer financial losses.\n• Guest damage due to theft, which can occur unexpectedly and pose financial challenges for landlords.\n• Income losses due to covered damages, minimizing your rental losses and ensuring financial stability.\n• Additional cleaning costs for the extensive removal of stains left by guests that go beyond normal cleaning.\n• Effective protection against pet damage, allowing you to rent to pet owners worry-free without the risk of high repair costs."
    },
    cost: {
      question: "How much does guest damage insurance cost?",
      answer: "Our guest damage insurance starts at €2.8 per night and varies depending on the coverage amount. You can find details in your Stellar account.\n\nThe insurance costs can also be paid by the guest as an alternative to the deposit.\n\nTo ensure the insurance covers all stays in your accommodations, you can specify in the settings that you'll pay for the insurance yourself and include the costs in the rental price."

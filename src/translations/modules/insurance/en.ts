    airbnb: {
      question: "Do I need your guest damage insurance even though I'm listed on Airbnb or Booking.com?",
      answer: "Yes, although platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com offer their own protection, both have their pitfalls and limitations.\n\nAirbnb's AirCover is not an insurance product and will always involve guests and ask them to pay for damages. Only if the guest refuses to pay might AirCover cover the damage. Reporting damage to Airbnb therefore always risks disputes with guests who deny responsibility or leave a negative review. Additionally, AirCover only covers lost income from confirmed Airbnb bookings, leaving hosts who offer on multiple platforms with cancellation costs and lost income.\n\nBooking.com's damage program merely facilitates damage resolution with your guests, and only if you've specifically set it up. The damage program is limited to €300 in the EU. This amount is displayed during the booking process and can negatively impact your booking conversion or search ranking."
    },
    deposit: {
      question: "Should I ask guests for a deposit?",
      answer: "A deposit can provide financial security in case the house is damaged during your guests' stay. It also ensures that guests take better care of the house during their stay, as they want to receive the deposit back in full and therefore pay special attention to leaving the house in good condition.\n\nIn general, however, guests often avoid offers that require a deposit, as it temporarily ties up money and can lead to deductions for minor issues.\n\nIf you choose Stellar guest damage insurance, you can avoid deposits altogether or offer your guests a convenient alternative.\n\nSince potential claims are usually handled without guest involvement, you can avoid disputes with guests - for more repeat bookings and more 5-star reviews."
    },
    coverage: {
      question: "What does your insurance cover?",
      answer: "Our vacation rental insurance was specifically designed for the individual needs of short-term renters and owners.\n\nIt includes comprehensive and critical coverage for the following relevant cases:\n\n• Unintentional and malicious damage to your property (at replacement value), so you don't suffer financial losses.\n• Guest damage due to theft, which can occur unexpectedly and present financial challenges for landlords.\n• Income losses due to covered damages, minimizing your rental losses and ensuring financial stability.\n• Additional cleaning costs for elaborate removal of stains left by guests that go beyond normal cleaning.\n• Effective protection against damage caused by pets, so you can rent to pet owners without worrying about high repair costs."
    },
    cost: {
      question: "How much does guest damage insurance cost me?",
      answer: "Our guest damage insurance starts at €2.8 per night and varies depending on the level of coverage. Details can be found in your Stellar account.\n\nThe cost of insurance can also be covered by the guest, as an alternative to a deposit.\n\nTo ensure that the insurance covers all stays in your accommodations, you can specify in the settings that you will pay for the insurance yourself and include the costs in the rental price."

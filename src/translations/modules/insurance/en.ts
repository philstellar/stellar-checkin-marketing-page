      question: "How does this insurance work with Airbnb's AirCover?",

    deposit: {
      question: "Can I offer both insurance and traditional deposits to my guests?",
      answer: "Yes, you can offer both options to your guests during the check-in process. This flexibility allows guests to choose their preferred method of coverage, enhancing their booking experience while ensuring your property remains protected."
    },
    coverage: {
      question: "What types of damages are covered by the insurance?",
      answer: "Our insurance covers a wide range of damages including furniture, electronics, appliances, fixtures, structural damage, theft, and vandalism. It also includes unique features like \"new for old\" replacement and protection against rental loss due to property damage."
    },
    cost: {
      question: "How much does the insurance cost and who pays for it?",
      answer: "The insurance cost varies based on the coverage level you select. The guest pays for the insurance as part of their booking, typically between â‚¬8-15 per stay depending on the property size and coverage amount. As a host, you earn a commission on each policy sold."
    },
    process: {
      question: "How do I file a claim and how quickly will it be processed?",
      answer: "Filing a claim is simple through your host dashboard. Document the damage with photos, provide a brief description, and submit your claim. Our claims are typically processed within 48-72 hours, significantly faster than traditional deposit claims which can take weeks to resolve."
    },
    implementation: {
      question: "How do I implement the insurance system with my booking process?",
      answer: "Implementation is seamless through our API or direct integration with major booking platforms. You can also use our white-label solution that integrates directly into your booking website. Our team provides full setup support to ensure a smooth integration with your existing systems."

      question: "Do I need your guest insurance even if I list on Airbnb or Booking.com?",
      answer:
        "Yes—even though platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com provide some coverage, there are significant limitations. Airbnb's AirCover is not traditional insurance and always involves the guest, asking them to pay for damages. Only if the guest refuses does AirCover come into play. This can lead to conflict with guests, negative reviews, and is limited to Airbnb bookings. Booking.com's deposit program merely facilitates disputes with guests and is capped at €300 in the EU, potentially affecting your ranking or conversion. Our insurance operates independently and without those guest-facing issues."
    },
    repeat: {
      question: "Can guest damage insurance boost repeat bookings?",
      answer:
        "Repeat guests appreciate consistency and reliability. By providing insurance, managers and hosts demonstrate extra care, and guests know they won't face surprise charges or hidden fees. Claims are generally settled without guest involvement, ensuring a positive experience and encouraging loyalty and better reviews."
    },
    deposit: {
      question: "Should I still ask for a deposit?",
      answer:
        "Deposits can offer financial security and encourage careful treatment of your property. However, guests often avoid properties requiring deposits, due to the hassle and risk of deductions. With our guest damage insurance, you can skip deposits completely or present it as a convenience option. Claims are normally settled directly, avoiding guest disputes and helping drive more repeat bookings and 5-star reviews."
    },
    coverage: {
      question: "What does your insurance cover?",
      answer:
        "Our short-term rental insurance is custom-built for property managers and owners—a robust solution for these scenarios: Accidental and malicious property damage (with replacement value), guest theft, loss of income due to covered damages, extra cleaning costs for damage beyond normal wear-and-tear, pet damage, and more."
    },
    cost: {
      question: "What does guest damage insurance cost?",
      answer:
        "Our guest damage insurance starts at €2.80 per night—pricing depends on the chosen coverage. Details are in your Stellar account. You can choose to pay or pass costs to the guest as a deposit replacement. To ensure every stay is protected, you can cover the fee yourself and bundle it into your rates."
